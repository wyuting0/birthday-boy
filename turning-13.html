      <p>I turn 13 tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Looking back on the last 12 years, I'm <br>
         thankful for all the happy moments and <br>
         the growth that has shaped me into who I <br>
         am today. </p>
      <p>The challenges I've faced, whether in <br>
         school or in my personal life, have <br>
         taught me resilience and the importance <br>
         of hard work. As I step into my teenage <br>
         years, I'm both excited and a little <br>
         nervous about what's to come. </p>
      <p>There's beauty in completion. And always <br>
         faith in the unknown.</p>
      <p>Thank you all.</p>
